# Retail Data Cleaning Automation
During my time working with a retail company, I frequently encountered the need to fetch the Item Masterâ€”a list of SKUs with details such as ISBN, Name, MRP, Cost price, and more. Unfortunately, I found myself facing similar data issues repeatedly, making it a repetitive and time-consuming task.

To streamline this process and improve efficiency, I developed a Python script that automates data cleaning and fixes various issues in the data format. This script serves as a valuable tool for anyone working with retail data, eliminating manual efforts and reducing the chances of human error.
